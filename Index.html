    <h3>Lets discuss mode about the navigation bar</h3>
    <p>What is an Interactive Navigation Menu?
      An interactive navigation menu refers to a navigation bar or menu that goes beyond simple links. It includes features that improve user experience (UX) and engage visitors. Key features can include:
      <br>
      Hover Effects: Elements change style when hovered over, signaling that they are clickable.<br>
      Dropdowns: Submenus that appear when hovering or clicking on a parent item, allowing you to group related links.
      <br>Mobile Responsiveness: The ability to adjust the menu layout for different screen sizes, including collapsible or "hamburger" menus for mobile devices.
      <br>Smooth Scrolling: Clicking on a link scrolls smoothly to the targeted section of the page.
      <br>Active Link Highlighting: A link is highlighted to indicate which section the user is currently viewing.
      <br><br>Why is an Interactive Navigation Menu Important?
      <br>Improves User Experience (UX): An interactive navigation menu provides users with clear, easy-to-find, and responsive controls to explore the site.
      <br>Aesthetics: It makes a website visually appealing and engaging by offering dynamic effects and modern design practices.
      <br>Responsiveness: With mobile devices being a significant part of web traffic, having a responsive navigation menu is essential for offering good usability across devices.
      <br>Usability: Easy-to-use menus allow users to quickly find information, improving the efficiency of interaction with the site.
      <br>Accessibility: By ensuring that interactive menus are easy to navigate with the keyboard or screen reader, web accessibility standards can be met.
      <br><br>Types of Interactive Navigation Menus
      <br>Horizontal Navigation Bar: The most common type, displayed at the top of the page. Links are listed horizontally.
      <br>Vertical Sidebar: A navigation bar that appears on the left or right side of the page, often with more categories or subcategories.
      <br>Dropdown Navigation: Links that expand into a menu when hovered over or clicked.
      <br>Hamburger Menu: A compact, mobile-friendly menu with three horizontal lines that expand into a vertical menu on click. </p>
